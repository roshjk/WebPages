    <section class="Blog-Introduction">
        <p>
            <strong>Technology</strong> has become an integral part of human lives. Birth of the industrial revolution has caused among other things, an exponential grown in technology. 
            Many of the most valuable companies in this age are tech companies. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and many more in their core are tech companies. Our daily 
            lives have become so synonymous with technology that without it, many of our lives would be meaningless. 
        </p>

        <!-- <img src="../../images/BlogFront.jpg" alt="" style="width: 500px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; border-radius: 8px;"> -->

        <p>
            But what exactly is technology and how much does it really affect our daily lives? Technology is the application of scientific knowledge in practical everyday human life, 
            to change and manipulate the human environment (Britannica, 2022). Technology is everywhere, the phones we are so addicted to, refrigerators we store our food in, TVs, 
            Heaters, Fans we are surrounded by technology. The term tech now mostly refers to phones, tv’s and the next big thing. But technology in simple terms is to apply knowledge 
            for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way (Skolnikoff, 1993).
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people agree that the new age of technology has undoubtedly become an asset in further growth of the human civilization. We have been to the moon, landed machines 
            in mars, found cures for many diseases and most importantly increased the quality of life for the human population with the help of technology. But recently, people 
            have become worried that we are becoming too reliant in technology. In a study conducted by Penn State University, it was found that 77% of people believed that society 
            as a whole relied too much on technology (Penn State University, 2015). Lets dive deeper into both the positive and the negative impact of technology today.
        </p>

    <section class="blog-positiveImpacts">
        <p>
            <em><strong>Positive Impact:</strong></em> Undoubtedly the most positive impact of technology for us is the increase in quality of life. We can store foods for longer, 
            cook better, drink cleaner water, stay healthier, commute better and so much more because of advancements made in technology. If we don’t know anything 
            we can quickly look it up on the internet, we can learn new things, relearn things we might have forgotten even set reminders for things we might forget, 
            all because of technology. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The benefit technology has made to health sector is also massive. Cures for many deadly diseases have been found. People who in the past had to suffer 
            because there was no cure can now live life normally. Doctors can perform operations to patients from a different continent. More than 50% of blindness now can 
            be cured because of advancement in technology (Weber, 2018). 
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than that, we have advancements made in transportation, energy production, agriculture and even growth of business. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But the most impactful development technology has ever made in my opinion, is the birth of social media and by extension, the internet. The world has become more 
            connected than ever, with information travelling around the globe within seconds. Communicating with loved ones in a completely different continent, in real time seems 
            like magic. Businesses can grow and find a wider audience because of the internet. 
        </p>

    <section class="blog-NegativeImpacts">
        <p>
            <em><strong>Negative Impact:</strong></em> Technological advancement today has come with a big responsibility. The advancement made in nuclear technology has been great for sustainable energy 
            but along with that there now is always a looming threat of nuclear winter. Social media has affected the growth of children and people’s mental health. 
            A <a href ="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(17)30016-8/fulltext" target="_blank">2017 study</a> showed that young adults with high social media use were three times 
            more likely to feel socially isolated than people who didn’t use social media that often. Not only that, a  there have been cases of people being physically injured because they were focused
            on their phones while walking, driving etc. There also has been cases of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/tics-and-tiktok-can-social-media-trigger-illness-202201182670">Teens developing tick disease</a> 
            because they saw a video on Tiktok. Parents are making their children dependent on phones from a very early age because it is easier for them. This not only affects the child's physical health but also 
            affects their mental health in the long term. Many people cannot eat or even go to the bathroom if they do not have their phones with them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The dependency on tech, for even minute daily tasks has become an epidemic and is showing no signs of slowing down. Students use AI to do their homeworks, write essays who knows, even this blog might
            be written using AI technology. The evolutionary instinct of human beings slowly removes things and functionality if it is found useless. For example we had tails a long time ago, but because we didnt use
            it, evolution took it away. Is there a possibility that the same might happen to our mind? What separates humans from animals is that they do not act entirely on instinct. They have a consciousness, a moral 
            compass. But what happens if we rely on technology to make the conscious decisions for us? 
        </p>

        <p>
            The negative impacts of technology are not caused because technology in itself is bad, it is caused because of we are using it in a bad way. We need to be more responsible 
            with the technology we have been given.

    <section class="blog-ImpactOnBonsai">
        <p>
            <em><strong>Impact of technology while selling bonsai plants:</strong></em> Our company, origin-bonsai is fully online. We do not have any physical stores and all our business is conducted from the internet. 
            Technology for us has been game changing. Without it, there would be no origin bonsai. We established this company in 2016 because of our love for bonsai plants. We sell a limited 
            species of bonsai because we aim for quality, not quantity. Because of this, we even have the option to hire an expert. They will come to your home and teach you everything needed 
            to take care of your new bonsai. We are glad that the technology today is advanced enough that we can conduct this business without having any physical stores. The Ad campaigns we
            run on social media increases our exposure to a wider audience, which in turn increases sales. Like any company, we are driven by profit as much as we are driven by our love for bonsai. 
            Technology has helped us maximize our profit and decrease overhead costs. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If it was not for technology, there would be no origin Bonsai. When we first came up with the idea of selling bonsai plants, we went out to look for physical stores around kathmandu. But the rent 
            was so high that we had lost all hope. We were a bunch of broke students with a dream. None of us had the gut to take out a loan for initial investment. That is when one of our team members 
            came up with the idea of opening an online store. The initial cost then would be much lower. We went on to design our website and started to work on our dream. All of that was possible because
            of technology. It shows that what we get out of technology depends entirely on how we use it. We will forever be thankful to the people behind this age and all the facilities we have.
        </p>

    <section class="blog-conclusion">
        <p>
           <strong> In conclusion,</strong> technology is a boon for human population if we use it responsibly. Many people have found their purpose, their livelihood because of technology. It has caused harm 
            to a few, but in contrast it has helped billions of people in various ways we may not have even imagined. Technology when used properly can be amazing, sometimes outright magical. Imagine, being
            able to see for the first time in your life because of technology. To be able to talk with the one you love even tho they are on a completely different continent. Things we once though were 
            impossible now has become possible because of technology. It is in our hands to choose how to use the technology we have, do we use it for good? or do we use it for bad? Everything lies in our hands.
            So, when used with good intent, technology is amazing. But when used with bad intent, technology can be dangerous.
